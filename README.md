This is fork of this ⬇️ using FastHTML + sqlite-vec

This is a demo of a movie search engine. This project is inspired by [Andrej Karpathy's weekend hack](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1647372603907280896) and is forked from this old project [weaviate/weaviate-examples/movies-search-engine](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate-examples/tree/main/movies-search-engine).
